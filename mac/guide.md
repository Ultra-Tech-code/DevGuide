## Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions tailored for macOS users

## Setting up Your  Development Environment

Here are the general requirements:
- Python3
- Node.js
- Yarn
- Docker Desktop

### Installing & Configuring Docker

1. Download Docker Desktop using any of the URLs below 
- [Docker Desktop for Mac with Apple Silicon](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/Docker.dmg?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-mac-arm64&_gl=1*1phjm84*_ga*MTA0MTIzOTI4LjE2OTcyNzA0OTY.*_ga_XJWPQMJYHQ*MTY5NzQ2ODc2Ny41LjEuMTY5NzQ2ODkyNy42MC4wLjA)

- [Docker Desktop for Mac with Intel Chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/amd64/Docker.dmg?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-mac-amd64&_gl=1*vl017u*_ga*MTA0MTIzOTI4LjE2OTcyNzA0OTY.*_ga_XJWPQMJYHQ*MTY5NzQ2ODc2Ny41LjEuMTY5NzQ2ODkyNy42MC4wLjA.)

2. After the `Docker.dmg` file is downloaded, open the installer, then drag the Docker icon to the Applications folder. 
Double-click on the Docker.app in the Applications folder to start Docker.

### Installing Python

1. Install Homebrew (if not already installed):

     ```
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
     ```

2. Install Python 3 using the following command:

     ```
     brew install python@3
     ``` 

### Installing Node.js/NPM

1. If you have Homebrew installed, open a terminal and run:

    ```
    brew install node
    ```

### Installing Yarn

1. If you have Homebrew installed, open a terminal and run:

    ```
    brew install yarn
    ``` 


### Check for RISC-V support

1. Launch Docker Desktop to start the engine and then run this command to check if your Docker supports the RISCV platform:

   ```
   docker buildx ls
   ```

   If you do not see linux/riscv64 in the platforms list, install QEMU which will be used by Docker to emulate RISC-V instructions to build a Cartesi Machine with the command below: 

   ```
   sudo apt install qemu-user-static
   ```

   After installing QEMU, the platform `linux/riscv64` should appear in the platforms list. Docker now supports the RISCV platform

## Build your backend | Python Tutorial

This section is the Python tutorial for the dApp


### Step 1: Creating your backend 

1. Fork and Clone the [rollups-examples](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples) repository for sample project examples 


2. Change the directory 

   `
   cd calculator
   `

    The backend code can be found in the `calculator.py` file. The backend receives mathematical expressions as inputs and generates notices with the result of the corresponding evaluations. 


### Step 2: Run the environment locally (Host Mode)

1. Make sure you still have the Docker engine up and running

2. Build the Docker images from the pre-configured Docker configuration for each template by running the command (in the `calculator` directory): 

   ```
   docker buildx bake --load
   ```


3. Start your local node from the images you just built by running:

   ```
   docker compose -f ../docker-compose.yml -f ./docker-compose.override.yml -f ../docker-compose-host.yml up
   ```


### Step 3: Run the backend
Next, we will run the application's backend inside the running local node. 

Inside the root directory of `calculator` folder, enter the following commands to run the backend:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
ROLLUP_HTTP_SERVER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5004" python3 echo.py
```

You can use also "entr" to automatically restart the backend whenever it detects changes:

```
ls *.py | ROLLUP_HTTP_SERVER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5004" entr -r python3 echo.py
```


### Step 4: Interacting with the backend(Frontend Interaction)

Now we can send input to our backend (a transaction) via the frontend. You can build your custom frontend or use the example [frontend console](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/tree/main/frontend-console). 

In the rollups-examples repo, we cloned earlier.  

1. Open a new terminal and change the directory to frontend-console:

   ```
   cd frontend-console
   ```


2. Install and build the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```
    yarn
    yarn build
   ```

3. Send your input/transaction to the running node by running:


   ```
   yarn start input send --payload "3+5"
   ```

4. To check these notices, run the following command:

   ```
   yarn start notice list
   ```

Congratulations! You just built and ran your first dApp on Cartesi Rollups! 


### Step 5: Shutting down the local node

To shut down the node and eliminate all active Docker containers, you can follow these steps

1. Terminate the environment by using the shortcut CTRL + C.

2. Run the command below in your dApp directory:

   ```
   docker compose -f ../docker-compose.yml -f ./docker-compose.override.yml down -v
   ```

## Build your backend | JavaScript Tutorial

This section is the JavaScript tutorial for the dApp


### Step 1: Creating your backend 

1. Fork and Clone the [rollups-examples](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples) repository for sample project examples 


2. Change the directory 

   `
   cd echo-js
   `

    The backend code can be found in the `dapp.js` file. The backend copies (or "echoes") each input received as a corresponding output notice. 


### Step 2: Run the environment locally (Host Mode)

1. Make sure you still have the Docker engine up and running

2. Build the Docker images from the pre-configured Docker configuration for each template by running the command (in the `calculator` directory): 

   ```
   docker buildx bake --load
   ```


3. Start your local node from the images you just built by running:

   ```
   docker compose -f ../docker-compose.yml -f ./docker-compose.override.yml -f ../docker-compose-host.yml up
   ```


### Step 3: Run the backend
Next, we will run the application's backend inside the running local node. 

Inside the root directory of `calculator` folder, enter the following commands to run the backend:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

You can use also "entr" to automatically restart the backend whenever it detects changes:

```
ls *.js | entr -r yarn start
```


### Step 4: Interacting with the backend(Frontend Interaction)

Now we can send input to our backend (a transaction) via the frontend. You can build your custom frontend or use the example [frontend console](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/tree/main/frontend-console). 

In the rollups-examples repo, we cloned earlier.  

1. Open a new terminal and change the directory to frontend-console:

   ```
   cd frontend-console
   ```


2. Install and build the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```
    yarn
    yarn build
   ```

3. Send your input/transaction to the running node by running:


   ```
   yarn start input send --payload "Hello World"
   ```

4. To check these notices, run the following command:

   ```
   yarn start notice list
   ```

Congratulations! You just built and ran your first dApp on Cartesi Rollups! 


### Step 5: Shutting down the local node

To shut down the node and eliminate all active Docker containers, you can follow these steps

1. Terminate the environment by using the shortcut CTRL + C.

2. Run the command below in your dApp directory:

   ```
   docker compose -f ../docker-compose.yml -f ./docker-compose.override.yml down -v
   ```

## Deploying your backend

Until now, weâ€™ve been deploying on a localhost testnet chain and every transaction so far has been to contracts on our local chain.

Here are the supported public testing networks with the Cartesi Rollups infrastructure:

```
gnosis_chiado
arbitrum_goerli
optimism_goerli
polygon_mumbai
sepolia
```
### Step 1: Build your machine to deploy

You can specify which blockchain network you're building the back-end machine for by providing the network information. 

Build the back-end by running:

```
docker buildx bake machine --load --set *.args.NETWORK=<network>
```
Replace `<network>`  with your prefered network.


### Step 2: Deploying your app's backend

Great, we're all set for deployment with our Docker image. Here's what you need to do next:


1. Set your Metamask 12-word phrase as an environment variable:   
      ```
      export MNEMONIC=your 12 words here
      ```


2. Set your Sepolia RPC URL as an environment variable: 
      ```
	export RPC_URL=your RPC URL here
	```


3. Deploy to the Cartesi dApp factory contract on the target network:
     ```
     DAPP_NAME=<example> docker compose --env-file ../env.<network> -f ../deploy-testnet.yml up
     ```

     Replace `<example>` with your project name and `<network>` with the target network(ie sepolia)


4. Once the deployment is successful, stop the docker containers and remove the volumes created by running:
    ```
    DAPP_NAME=<example> docker compose --env-file ../env.<network> -f ../deploy-testnet.yml down -v
    ```


5. After successful deployment, a file will be created at ../deployments/<network>/<example>.json (in the root of the rollups-example directory) with the deployed contract's address. Or run the command below for the address to be printed in your console: 

   ```
   cat ../deployments/<network>/<example>.json
   ```

### Step 4: Run a validator node
Before setting up a Cartesi Validator Node, you should have already deployed your smart contract to a target blockchain network

1. Additional environment variables: You'll need a secure WebSocket endpoint for the RPC gateway (WSS URL). For our Sepolia RPC, here is how we can set it:

   ```
   export WSS_URL=wss://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/****
   ```


2. Build a server manager for your target network: 
   ```
   docker buildx bake server --load --set *.args.NETWORK=sepolia
   ```



3. Start the Validator Node

   ```
   DAPP_NAME=<example> docker compose --env-file ../env.<network> -f ../docker-compose-testnet.yml -f ./docker-compose.override.yml up
   ```



4. Alternative (HOST MODE)

   If you prefer, you can run the validator node in host mode by executing this command:

    ```
    DAPP_NAME=<example> docker compose --env-file ../env.<network> -f ../docker-compose-testnet.yml -f ./docker-compose.override.yml -f ../docker-compose-host-testnet.yml up
    ```
    This process ensures your Cartesi Validator Node is up and running, ready to interact with your dApp's smart contract and handle the back-end logic effectively
